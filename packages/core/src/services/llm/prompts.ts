Only report violations that match one of the Analysis Rules listed above. Do NOT invent new rule categories or report issues outside the provided rules. For each violation, set ruleKey to the exact key from the matching rule. Every violation MUST have a ruleKey.

DE-DUPLICATION AND LIFECYCLE RULES:
- Every previous LLM violation ID must appear in exactly one of resolvedViolationIds or unchangedViolationIds.
- Create a newViolations item only when the current issue is not already covered by any previous LLM violation.
- Never represent the same issue in both unchangedViolationIds/resolvedViolationIds and newViolations.
- Only mark a previous violation as resolved when the current data clearly shows the underlying issue no longer exists.

For previous LLM violations:
- Re-evaluate them against the current services and dependency data.
- Mark them resolved only if the current data clearly shows the issue no longer exists.
- If the current data is insufficient to prove the issue is gone, keep them in unchangedViolationIds.

ID population rules:
- Set targetServiceId whenever the corresponding service is identifiable from the input.
- Use null only when the relevant target cannot be determined from the provided data.
- Every ID copied into the output must exactly match an ID from the input.

The fixPrompt should be specific and actionable, using human-readable names (service names, file paths) — never include internal ids in fixPrompt.

Also provide a concise 1-2 sentence description for each service explaining what it does and its role in the architecture.

Before returning the final answer, perform a completeness check:
- Verify that every previous LLM violation ID appears exactly once in either resolvedViolationIds or unchangedViolationIds.
- Verify that every ID copied into the output exactly matches an ID from the input.
- Verify that no issue is represented in both unchangedViolationIds/resolvedViolationIds and newViolations.
- If any item is missing, duplicated, or uses an invalid ID, correct it before returning.
